## Development

To develop a Figma plugin you need to install the desktop app. Learn more in the [Figma Plugin docs](https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/setup/).

Available commands:

- `npm run dev`: starts the watcher for changes. Modify the files under the `src` folder and the code will be compiled automatically. Then, go to the Figma app and run your development plugin.
- `npm run build`: generates the production build in the `dist` folder. Before generating the build, it checks the TypeScript code for linting errors.
- `npm run test`: simple test that ensures that the `ui.html` and `plugin.js` files have been generated in the `dist` folder.
- `npm run lint`: lint TypeScript code.
- `npm run lint:fix`: lint and apply automatic fixes to TypeScript code. This script runs before `build`.
