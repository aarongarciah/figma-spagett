Figma plugin to make your designs spooky. [Get it!](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/824061077635063809/Spagett!)

## How it works

When executing the plugin there's two possible scenarios:

1. If some layers is selected: Spagett will be added as a fill to every selected layer.
2. No layer is selected: Spagett will be added as a fill to every layer that already has a fill in the page.
